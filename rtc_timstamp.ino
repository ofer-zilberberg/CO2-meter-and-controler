  //        - Aging adjustment
  //        - Temperature compensation
  //        - Accuracy tuning
  // The offset mode to use, once every two hours or once every minute.
  // The offset Offset value from -64 to +63. See the Application Note for calculation of offset values.
  // https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN11247.pdf
  // The deviation in parts per million can be calculated over a period of observation. Both the drift (which can be negative)
  // and the observation period must be in seconds. For accuracy the variation should be observed over about 1 week.
  // Note: any previous calibration should canceled prior to any new observation period.
  // Example - RTC gaining 43 seconds in 1 week
  float drift = 43; // seconds plus or minus over observation period - set to 0 to cancel previous calibration.
  float period_sec = (7 * 86400);  // total observation period in seconds (86400 = seconds in 1 day:  7 days = (7 * 86400) seconds )
  float deviation_ppm = (drift / period_sec * 1000000); //  deviation in parts per million (Î¼s)
  float drift_unit = 4.34; // use with offset mode PCF8523_TwoHours
// float drift_unit = 4.069; //For corrections every min the drift_unit is 4.069 ppm (use with offset mode PCF8523_OneMinute)
//  int offset = round(deviation_ppm / drift_unit);
  int offset = 0; // no offset.
  // rtc.calibrate(PCF8523_TwoHours, offset); // Un-comment to perform calibration once drift (seconds) and observation period (seconds) are correct
  // rtc.calibrate(PCF8523_TwoHours, 0); // Un-comment to cancel previous calibration
